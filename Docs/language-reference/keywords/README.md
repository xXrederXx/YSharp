# YSharp Keywords

Keywords are predefined, reserved identifiers that have special meanings to the interpreter. They can't be used as identifiers in your program. Using them could cause errors or unexpected behaviour.

Here is a table of all keywords currently supportet in YSharp. Clicking on them will take you to their dedicated article.
